Generally, the correlation can be found by taking two functions and multiplying together the output for each function that corresponds to a given input. Then, the multiplied pairs are all summed to give a single correlation value for the two functions. The mathematical notation is quite simple but difficult to show in a Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "Even though these functions have the exact same shape, a and b have a much higher correlation due to b's large magnitude. One could argue that a and c are in fact MORE similar due to their more similar magnitudes. To solve this, one may use normalized correlation. It turns out to be not useful for ambient noise correlations as we care about maintaining magnitude differences, but normalized uses a weighted magnitude measurement to bring the value of correlation to between -1 and 1. This means it may give a more accurate sense of how similarly shaped two functions are, and can be used to compare all kinds of different functions regardless of their magnitude. This is shown below."

    "We've seen that correlation is just a unitless measurement of how similar two functions, or signals in the case of ambient seismic noise, are to one another. Cross-correlation asks the question,\"What if we took the second function, offset it to the left, and then swept it across the top function and measured the correlation of the two offset signals at every point?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Describing this in words is difficult, so I've implemented an interactive ipywidget below to show the basic setup. For two functions with length L, the second function is domain shifted to the left by an amount L. It could be said that the second function is now at an offset of -L. Then, the correlation is measured. Since these two functions have no overlap, and anything outside their data windows is just taken to be 0, the correlation should be 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine then moving the second function slightly to the right by an amount Delta. Delta is arbitary, but for real data it usually matches the sampling rate of the instrument. The second function now sits at an offset of -L+Delta. The correlation is then measured again, this time ONE data point should overlap between the two functions and a small correlation value will appear. Imagine repeating this process for every Delta-step until the second function is offset by positive L, by which point the two functions do not overlap and the correlation goes back to 0. We would then be left with a correlation value between the two functions for every step L, which we can interpret as a function with domain -L to L and time steps of Delta. This is a cross-correlation function.\n",
